# Security Policy

## Security shouldn't be an issue

I'd be surpised if there would occure any security issue with 4sg.xsl, given that you run the script localy, what you should do. Public installation of the required XSLT processor comes with enormous pricing.
What you release into the wild is only the generated SVG file, which has no scripting abilities generated into it.

If you discover any vulnerability of 4sg.xsl, please let me know and report an issue.
